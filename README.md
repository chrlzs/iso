## Architecture

The game uses a single GameInstance class that coordinates all game systems:
- Rendering using isometric projection on HTML5 Canvas
- Entity management with player, NPCs, and merchants
- World generation with terrain and structures
- UI system with inventory, merchant interactions, and messages
- Input handling for keyboard and mouse
- Debug tools and layout mode for development
```

3. Architecture

## Rendering System
- Isometric projection using HTML5 Canvas
- Layer-based rendering (terrain, entities, UI)
- Chunk-based world loading
- Camera system with pan/zoom

## Core Systems
- Input Management: Keyboard/Mouse handling
- World Grid: Chunk-based world management
- Entity System: Player, NPCs, Enemies
- Combat System: Turn-based or real-time
- Inventory System: Item management
- Save/Load System: Game state persistence

## Performance Optimizations
- Chunk-based rendering
- Entity pooling
- Viewport culling
- Asset preloading
